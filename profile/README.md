# Achivator: you deserve a medal!

Achivator is a social engagement platform for Telegram.

## Vision
Drives engagement in chats by awarding jettons and achievements.

## Description
Achievement systems is a well known gamification mechanic that drives engagement. On top, it allows ranking people in the community to highlight the prolific contributors. This project aims to bring achievements to Telegram.

Just add the bot to the chat, and it starts gathering statistics, based on which a bot awards chat specific jettons. Every positive emoji gives more jettons, and a positive emoj from the chat creator grants even more jettons. It's up to the chat owner to set what jettons will be distributed, but it is also totally optional.

On top of that, when a user hits an achievement metric â€” bot awards a medal that can be viewed in the mini app and purchased as TON NFT. When a user buys an NFT, the chat owner gets a royalty.

But this is just a beginning of the platform. We will add the chat statistics so that you will be able to see which achievements are rare and who owns them. Admins will be able to award achievements or create unique medals just for their chat.

Achivator will bring joy and friendly competition to any telegram chat and make users happier!
